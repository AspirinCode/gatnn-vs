# Graph Attention Neural Network for Virtual Screening

GATNN-VS is a neural network architecture, and a learning framework designed to yield a generally applicable tool for ligand-based virtual screening. Our approach uses the molecular graph as input, and involves learning a representation that places compounds of similar biological profiles in close proximity within a hyperdimensional feature space; this is achieved by simultaneously leveraging historical screening data against a multitude of targets during training. Cosine distance between molecules in this space becomes a general similarity metric, and can readily be used to rank order database compounds in LBVS workflows
