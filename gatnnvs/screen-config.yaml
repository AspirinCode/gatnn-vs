      Usage:

      python3 -m gatnnvs.${hydra.job.name} query=QUERY library=LIBRARY [Options...]

      == Config ==
      Override anything in the config (foo.bar=value)

      query: Input csv file with (at least) a 'smiles' column.
      library: npy file with generated fingerprints
      model_path: Directory where model weights and config is located.
          Defaults to ${env:HOME}/.local/share/gatnnvs/gatnn-model-final where pretrained model will be automatically downloaded if necessary.
      device: Defaults to CPU, as it is expected that number of query molecules is small.
      output: Name of the output file, derived from query if omited.
